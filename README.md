This is my latest update. I could not get any commits done over the weekend because i was working at my other job. Last week i was able to install eclipse and OpenOffice on my machine. 

Today (June 13, 2016) I started doing some more research on JSP. I updated a few pages on our wiki page to keep them accurate and up to date. I also created a new account on wikipedia.org and started to look around to edit some stuff on their site. 

I am now starting to get the hang of things thanks to my mentors. I will keep updating this file daily so I can keep it up to date!

Today (June 14, 2016) I was able to install MAVEN and JSPWiki on my machine. I had a few errors with JSPWiki that I was not able to resolve. Also, after waiting for hours I was able to clone OpenOffice, but I am still waiting to find a way to install it. I tried a few commands but I was not successful with my installation attempt.
