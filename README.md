This is my latest update. I could not get any commits done over the weekend because i was working at my other job. Last week i was able to install eclipse and OpenOffice on my machine. 

Today (June 13, 2016) I started doing some more research on JSP. I updated a few pages on our wiki page to keep them accurate and up to date. I also created a new account on wikipedia.org and started to look around to edit some stuff on their site. 

I am now starting to get the hang of things thanks to my mentors. I will keep updating this file daily so I can keep it up to date!

=============================================================================

Today (June 14, 2016) I was able to install MAVEN and JSPWiki on my machine. I had a few errors with JSPWiki that I was not able to resolve. Also, after waiting for hours I was able to clone OpenOffice, but I am still waiting to find a way to install it. I tried a few commands but I was not successful with my installation attempt. 

=============================================================================

Today (June 15th, 2016) I gained even more knowledge. I learned the difference between .jar and .war files, 
learned how to install maven and jspwiki using git and install openOffice. I also installed notepad++, chrome,
and 7zip. 

=============================================================================

Today (June 16th, 2016) I finally started working more on wiki. I started converting a big doc file that was assigned to us to the wiki page. I enjoyed working with wiki because I gained more knowledge on how to use wiki and learned the syntax that is being used on there. I was not able to finish converting the whole doc file but I plan on doing that tomorrow. The plan for tomorrow is to get that wiki file done and the OpenOffice installed using git. 

=============================================================================


Today (June 17th, 2016) We were finally able to finish converting the whole document to wiki. It took us a while to get it done but we managed. This conversion helped us tremendously. This is because we learned more about wiki synatx. We also started looking for ways we can convert a doc file to wiki without doing it manually. Also, we are still trying to install OpenOffice using git. However, allI found was commands for Lunix and not for Windows.

(June 20th, 2016) - Today I edited and created a few wiki pages on our site. I also began searching for code to convert from a word doc to mediaWiki. Tomorrow I have to convert some more documents on our wiki site. This helps me practice and learn more wiki synatax.

=============================================================================

(June 21st, 2016) - More wiki pages created and edited. I learned more wiki syntax especially tables. We still have more pages to create on the wiki site. 

=============================================================================

(June 22, 2016) - We were able to finish all the document that were given to us and converted them to wiki. It took us a 
while to do it because of all the tables that were on the document. After doing these documents, we now understand how
wiki works. 

=============================================================================

(June 23, 2016) - Today we spent most of our day just looking over and modifying wiki pages. We also spent a good amount of time on practicing Java code using eclipse. We still need more practice on eclipse because we have not had to use it in a while. Tomorrow we will do more on eclipse and try to write some more code and get used to it better. 

===============================================================================

(June 24, 2016) - Today I was able to clone the JSPWIKI script on my laptop. I kept looking over it that script so I can get an idea about how it works. It looks a little bit complicated because the script has some errors in it. I am still waiting to get the Microsoft wikiMedia add-in for word. This will help convert word documents to wiki easily instead of having to conveert them manually. 

===============================================================================

(June 25, 2016) - None.

===============================================================================

(June 26, 2016) - None.

===============================================================================

(June 27, 2016) - Today we were able to use the wikiMedia extension for office.
That add-in really helps with converting the documents to wiki. I also worked a
little more on Java and practiced some code. I am still looking for the mediaWik
i extension source code to see if we can fix it to make it compatible with our w
iki site.

===============================================================================

(June 28, 2016) - Today we spent most of our day just modifying wiki pages on ou
r site, as well as practicing some java code using eclipse editor. We are waitin
g on more documents to convert to wiki using our new extension for office. It re
ally comes in handy.

===============================================================================

(June 29, 2016) - Today we spent our day converting more documents to our wiki p
age. We also looked over some code and tried to understand it but it is pretty difficult to grasp the first time. We were not at work all day because we had an intern event that we had to attend.

===============================================================================

(June 30, 2016) - Today I was able to convert a lot of documents to our wiki pag
e. I also gained some knowledge about regular expressions. Those can be used to
help with the conversion process.

===============================================================================

(July 1, 2016) - Today I spent my day learning more wiki syntax. I alos created
and converted a lot of documents to our wiki page. It is really good practice fo
r us.

===============================================================================
