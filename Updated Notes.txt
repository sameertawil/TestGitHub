Today (June 15th, 2016) I gained even more knowledge. I learned the difference between .jar and .war files, 
learned how to install maven and jspwiki using git and install openOffice. I also installed notepad++, chrome,
and 7zip. 

Notes:
Jar vs War files

	Java Archives (JAR) are files that contain libraries, resources and accessories files like property files. 
	
	Web Archives (WAR) are files that contain the web application that can be deployed on any servlet/jsp container. 
	The war file contains jsp, html, javascript and other files necessary for the development of web apps. 

How to convert word to wiki?

	After reading some articles online on how to convert doc files to wiki, I came to conclude that there are a few 
	things we can do. Those include using the mediaWiki add-in for word which helps us save the files as a wiki type, 
	or we can save our doc file as an html file and conevert it to wiki using some kind of converter such as Universal Wiki Converter, 
	or we can use OpenOffice to convert the doc but first we have to download the Sun-publisher add-in for OpenOffice so 
	that we are able to save files as MediaWiki type. 

Today (June 16th, 2016) I finally started working more on wiki. I started converting the big doc file that was assigned to 
us to the wiki page. I enjoyed working with wiki because I gained more knowledge on how to use wiki and learned the syntax 
that is being used on there. I did not get the whole doc file converted but I plan on finishing it tomorrow. The plan for 
tomorrow is to get that wiki file done and the OpenOffice installed using git.
